Environment Setup : https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup
Follow the React Native CLI quickstart to just setup path to Android SDK and downloading emulator image etc. (Not sure if expo does this setup automatically)

install expo with yarn/npm :
npm install -g expo-cli

navigate to project folder:
cd rn_expo_test

expo start
